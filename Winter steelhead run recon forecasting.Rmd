Steve Gray emailed me some 2023 estimates today so I was able to run the code to impute the missing estimates and calculate the river mouth run size, which is what we need for the JSR. The River mouth run size is just the sum of all of the escapements plus the mainstem harvest.  


Plot of escapement estimates (black points) and imputed estimates (red points). I used a DFW model with 3 latent states fit in MARSS to do the impuation. The idea behind it is that it accounts for the covariance across populations but without having to fit a ful covariance matrix, which has a lot of parameters and is hard to estimate because many of our population time series are short.  
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=15, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#plot of imputed values
imputes$p2
```


plot of annual sums (including imputed values) with numbers of missing (i.e. imputed) values per year.  
```{r , echo=FALSE}
#plot of annual sums (including imputed values) with numbers of missing (i.e. imputed) values per year
imputes$p3
```



```{r , echo=FALSE,out.width="75%"}

kableExtra::kable(RMR %>% tail() %>% mutate(across(c(Counts,runsize_obs),round)),col.names=c("Year","Escpmnt","n msng","Mstm hrvst","RM Run"),table.attr = "style='width:150%;'") %>%  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

Table of estimated river mouth run sizes over last 6 years.  

We could do a five-year average of the river mouth run size (2019-2023) for the 2024 forecast. That would be equal to `r RMR %>% tail(5) %>% summarize(f=round(mean(runsize_obs),-2))  %>% pull(f)%>% format(scientific=F)`. A ten-year average would be `r RMR %>% tail(10) %>% summarize(f=round(mean(runsize_obs),-2))  %>% pull(f)%>% format(scientific=F)`, but I think I would prefer the 5-year average. If we used auto-arima to generate a forecast it would be `r round(exp(forecast(fit,h=1)$mean[1]),-2) %>% format(scientific=F)`.

Here is the print out from auto.arima.    
```{r, echo=FALSE}
fit
```
